# Flickerbox: analysis of temporal contrast sensitivity measurements with the silent substiution paradigm

This R package contains functions for creating stimuli for an LED stimulator using the silent substition paradigm to create photoreceptor-isolating stimuli. It also contains functions for analyzing these data.

## Who is this package for?

This package is mainly for internal use within my lab, because everything is adapted to the Light4Sight-Software which was custom-made for us. In the future, some of the functions might by included in a package that can be used by more people.
